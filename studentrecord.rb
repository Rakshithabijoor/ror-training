# Write a ruby program to create array of hash of student records with each hash record having keys like name, roll no, marks

# Implement method in this program which takes array of hash and name as input and returns whether student is passed or failed based on passing marks (35)

# Implement another method to calculate and update hash with percentage based on marks obtained out of 100.
